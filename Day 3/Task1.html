<b>The Statue of Liberty</b> (<strong>Liberty Enlightening the World</strong>; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, United States. <i>The copper statue, a gift from the people of France,</i> was designed by French sculptor <em>Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi</em> and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.</p>

<p>The statue is a figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the <u>U.S. Declaration of Independence</u>. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward, <del>commemorating</del> the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.[8] After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.</p>

<p>The idea for the statue was born in 1865, when <mark>the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence</mark> (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.[9] The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

The statue was administered by the <small>United States Lighthouse</small> Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Limited numbers of visitors can access the rim of the pedestal and the interior of the statue's crown from within; public access to the torch has been barred since 1916.
