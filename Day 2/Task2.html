        <h2>Fear of Failure</h2>

        <p id="str">
            The greatest roadblock holding most people back from becoming rich is fear.
 
The process of building and acquiring wealth feels out of reach and impossible to most people.
 
When we were kids, most of us liked to take big risks, and as such, we learned how to crawl, how to walk, how to run, and finally how to ride a bicycle. As a kid brimming with faith, I can vividly remember how I used to believe that one day I would become rich and eliminate all our family’s financial problems.
 
However, as we grew older, we began to listen to a barrage of constant voices from adults warning us that we shall fall if we try this, or we shall fail and get embarrassed if we try that, and so on. Gradually, we lost our inner courage, and eventually, we completely replaced our courage with fear.
 
Life is about taking risks, but the risks must be calculated. Learning how to analyze, calculate, manage, and take calculated risks is a common trait many millionaires have.
 
I think it is safe to say that because most people fear failing and will never become millionaires.

<h2>Millionaire Mindset</h2>
<p id="st1">
    The biggest difference between rich and average people is not found in their education, luck, skills, or choice of investments; it’s found in their mindset.
 
Mindset defines how you think, speak, and act. It defines your vocabulary.
 
Frankly, most people do not have the mindset of a millionaire. The most onerous project on earth is not to earn a PhD degree, but to change your mindset.
 
Most people have a lot of money but still have the poverty mentality – they are failure-conscious. This is true when you consider that many people win large sums of money through lotteries but lose it all after only a couple of years.
 
The poverty mentality/failure consciousness is taught through our social and educational system by our parents, peers, schools, and the job market. In fact, our educational system still uses the 19th-century education model, which was to provide the labour market with qualified staff.
 
That’s why most people still look for jobs after graduating college instead of chasing the entrepreneurial dream, which although laden with risk, gives you the greatest opportunity to become a millionaire.
 
A millionaire mindset is the ability to make a million dollars even after losing a million dollars. In other words, losing a million dollars is nothing compared to losing your millionaire mindset.

<h2>Time Management</h2>
<p id="str2">
    It has often been said that “time is money,” and it is.
 
Most people will not even come close to becoming millionaires because they cannot manage their time.
 
There are only 24 hours in a single day, and this is the only time available to each one of us.
 
We are obligated to spend 8 of those hours either working, going to school, or attending college.
 
And we are mandated by nature to spend 8 of those hours sleeping. The remaining 8 hours are to be spent at our discretion. We can spend the time either on the couch watching television, watching movies, playing games, or going on a beer-drinking spree at the local pub.
 
The proliferation of social media has ensured that entertainment is brought into our bedrooms.
 
Alternatively, we can also spend the time attending a business course or building a business that will one day make us millionaires.
 
The difference between the rich and the poor is decided by how we spend the discretionary 8 hours.
Most people will not become millionaires because they never learned how to work smart.

 You have heard it said that hard work pays off. Indeed. I would say that hard work alone will never pay off; you must combine it with smart work .

In the 19th century, it took about 30 years to become rich.

In the 20th century, it took less than twenty years to become rich.

In the 21st century, it may take as little as six months to become rich, in connection with a definite and faultless plan.

All this depends on the smart implementation of a simple law called leverage.

Millionaires learn how to leverage other people’s time.  

Millionaires learn how to leverage other people’s money.

Millionaires learn how to leverage other people’s skills and talents.

Millionaires learn how to leverage machines and automation.
