            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> (ISO: <strong>Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī</strong>;[pron 1] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an <u>Indian lawyer</u>, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed <ins> nonviolent resistance</ins> to lead the successful campaign for <em>India's independence from British rule</em>. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in <mark>South Africa in 1914</mark>, is now used throughout the world.

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, <mark>Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London</mark>, and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.
